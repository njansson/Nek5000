# Nek5000 Short Tests

This directory contains a small subset of tests which could be useful for quick
verification or regression testing.  For example, the 
[Nek5000 Travis tests](https://travis-ci.org/Nek5000/Nek5000) will run these
tests upon a pull request in GitHub.  The full set of Nek5000 examples 
(including these) are available in a separate repo,
[NekExamples](https://github.com/Nek5000/NekExamples).
